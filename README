NOTICE: My fork is currently broken as I am working on porting grsecurities last
free patch to the mainline linux kernel. I am renaming and reorgainizing the
project to avoid trademark issues. The original patch was under the gplv2 Licsence
but I plan to use a modified MIT that will consist of my changes on top of theirs.

Linux kernel
============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
