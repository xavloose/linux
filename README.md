NOTICE: My fork is currently broken as I am working on porting grsecurity's last
free patch to the mainline linux kernel. I am renaming and reorgainizing the
project to avoid trademark issues. The original patch was under the gpl2 Licsence
but I plan to use a modified MIT that will consist of my changes on top of theirs.
I'll set up a link to such once I finished the port :)

## What I Have Done
### On The Last Patch
Broken up the patch into one directory deep levels. I'll slowly elminate them when I don't need them anymore

 - grsecurity-3.1-4.9.24-201704252333.patch.ref        The reference patch
### My changes/planned changes
 - change instances of grsecurity and grsec to xsec and gr instances to x
 - move the grsecurity root folder to /security/xsec and renamed files according to above
 - Make all of grsecurity's uncondiontional changes linked to Kconfig
 - Add support for other patches that didn't play nice like MuQSS and BFQ. This will most likely come at a increased security risk (of course).
 - More to come :)

Linux kernel
============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
